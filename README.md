This is a work in progress. I'm implementing features as I learn them, and continue to refine them as I go.

Due to the process of working on this as I learn, I've had to rewrite a lot of what was already created 
to improve the code for better maintainability, legibility, and to implement new features.


Completed Since Last Update:

- Removed Normalize.css due to conflicts it created
- Rewrote main styles for future responsiveness
- Added final carousel images
- Finished converting CSS to SASS

Future updates:

- Rewrite media queries (I took out the older ones due to sloppy code)
- Add CSS3 Animations
